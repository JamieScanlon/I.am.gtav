# I.am.gtav

A collection of GTAV mods

## Mods
### iam-emotes
Adds standard emotes with `/e <emote>` or `/emote <emote>`. Use `/e c` or `/e cancel` to cancel an emote
### ism-prop
Add a prop to the right hand or left hand of the ped.

## Purpose 
I started building out these mods as a personal project in order to learn modding for GTAV. My primary goal was to have well-structured, readable code and I'm sharing it in hopes that others can learn from it. My secondary goal is to develop mods that are user-friendly and conform to established standards for naming. I made emote names, for example, the same as other popular mods. This is intentional.
